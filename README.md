# Car-Price-Predictor
I created a Car Price Predictor Web App using Streamlit and used Machine Learning Model for Training. RandomForestRegressor is used as model for dataset . The data source is OLX for used car prices in Pakistan. 
R2 Score for RandomForestRegressor : 0.92
Cross Validation Score is the same almost maybe 0.93
